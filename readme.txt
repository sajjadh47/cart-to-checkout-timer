== Description ==

**Cart To Checkout Timer** is a powerful WooCommerce plugin designed to help store owners monitor how long products remain in customers' carts before checkout. By tracking and displaying real-time cart-to-checkout durations, this plugin provides valuable insights to optimize the shopping experience, reduce cart abandonment, and boost conversions.
